# Video-Store-Management-System

`Video Store Management System` is a simple [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web application for static content that includes a rental website.
It was created for [Final Year Project](http://lastminute.pythonanywhere.com/), but everyone is welcome to use it.

The project is web-based featuring open architecture that means the app keeps up with the dynamic needs of the rental store by addition of new systems & functionality.

The software consists of four key modules i.e. user registration, login, reservation and return/cancellation, and search movies.

## Roadmap

- Redo of UI/UX of the website.
- Allow for transaction on the site.
- User login using Google.
